              Viva Phrases That Make You Sound Structured
            </h1>
            <p class="section-subtitle">
              Structured phrases that help you answer any dental viva with
              confidence and clarity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- QUICK ANSWERS -->
          <section class="study-answer-card">
            <h2>Quick Answers</h2>

            <h3>Why do specific phrases matter in vivas?</h3>
            <p>
              They make your reasoning visible, so examiners can follow your
              structure and award marks quickly.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I use one set of phrases for different exams?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes — the same phrases work across ORE, ADC, NBDE/INBDE, MFDS, and
              NDEB because the logic of the viva is similar.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the safest way to start any answer?</h3>
            <p>
              Briefly state your overall approach first, then move through the
              steps or categories you will cover.
            </p>

            <h3>How do I sound calm when I am unsure?</h3>
            <p>
              Use holding phrases like “Based on the information given…” or “My
              first priority would be…” instead of staying silent.
            </p>
          </section>

          <article class="blog-body">
            <h2>1. Why examiners love structured phrases</h2>
            <p>
              In a viva, knowledge alone is not enough. Examiners also assess
              how you think, prioritise, and communicate under pressure. Clear
              “signpost” phrases tell them where you are going and what you will
              talk about next.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is not to sound robotic. The goal is to use simple
              language that quietly organises your answer into clean steps.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Powerful opening phrases for any question</h2>
            <div class="study-form-card">
              <h3>Go-to openers</h3>
              <p>
                1. “I would like to approach this in three steps: first…, then…,
                and finally…”<br />
                2. “To answer this, I’ll start with the definitions, then the
                classification, and then the management.”<br />
                3. “My main priorities here would be diagnosis, stabilisation,
                and then definitive treatment.”<br />
                4. “From an exam point of view, I would structure my answer as
                history, examination, investigations, and management.”
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              These phrases buy you a few seconds to think, while signalling
              that your answer will be organised rather than scattered.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Phrases for explaining diagnosis and reasoning</h2>
            <p>
              When you move from findings to diagnosis, structure is critical.
              Use linking phrases that show your logic:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>“The most likely diagnosis is … because we have …”</li>
              <li>“My differentials would include …, mainly due to …”</li>
              <li>
                “What pushes me towards this diagnosis is the combination of …”
              </li>
              <li>
                “If we had additional information such as …, it would support or
                refute this diagnosis.”
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Examiners want to see how you connect signs, symptoms, and
              investigations—these phrases make that connection explicit.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Phrases for safe management plans</h2>
            <p>
              Management answers often lose marks because they sound like a
              random list. Use short headers inside your speech:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                “I would divide the management into emergency, short-term, and
                long-term steps.”
              </li>
              <li>“First, I would address pain control and stabilisation…”</li>
              <li>
                “Next, I would focus on removing the cause and definitive
                treatment by…”
              </li>
              <li>
                “Finally, I would arrange follow-up, prevention, and patient
                education regarding …”
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The content can change depending on operative, endodontic, perio,
              or prostho — but the internal headings stay the same.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Safe phrases when you are unsure</h2>
            <p>
              Every candidate gets stuck. What matters is how you recover. Avoid
              saying “I don’t know” on its own; wrap uncertainty inside a
              structured, honest answer:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                “Based on the information provided, my best initial approach
                would be…”
              </li>
              <li>
                “I am not completely sure about the exact percentage, but the
                principle is that…”
              </li>
              <li>
                “I would check the current guideline from … and then choose
                between … and …”
              </li>
              <li>
                “If I felt out of my depth, I would seek senior advice while
                maintaining patient safety.”
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These phrases still show good judgment, professionalism, and
              awareness of limits—which are all examinable.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Daily practice plan for viva phrases</h2>
            <div class="study-form-card">
              <h3>5-minute viva drill</h3>
              <p>
                1. Pick one topic (e.g. pericoronitis, acute pulpitis, chronic
                periodontitis).<br />
                2. Ask yourself aloud: “How would you manage this case?”<br />
                3. Start with: “I would like to approach this in three steps…”
                and talk for 2–3 minutes.<br />
                4. After finishing, write down one better opening phrase and one
                better management phrase.<br />
                5. Repeat with a different topic tomorrow — same phrases, new
                content.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Small, repeated drills like this are enough to make these
              sentences automatic before your OSCE or viva day.
            </p>
