        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy explains when and how payments for DentAIstudy
          subscriptions may be refunded or cancelled. It should be read together with our
          <a href="terms.html">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>, <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>,
          and <a href="billing.html">Billing Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          DentAIstudy is a small, independent educational platform focused on AI-assisted study tools
          for dental students and residents. To keep the service sustainable, refunds are limited and
          are usually granted only in specific situations described below.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Free plan</h2>
        <p>
          DentAIstudy may offer a free tier or trial features. The free plan is not charged and therefore
          not eligible for refunds. We may change, limit, or discontinue the free plan at any time.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Paid subscriptions and billing</h2>
        <p>
          When you upgrade to a paid plan (for example, a Pro subscription), you are charged in advance
          for the chosen billing period (such as monthly or yearly). Unless stated otherwise during
          checkout, all prices are shown in USD and may be subject to local taxes or currency conversion
          by your payment provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payments for DentAIstudy may be processed by a third-party reseller and merchant of record
          (for example, Paddle or a similar provider). That reseller may appear as the seller on your
          invoice or bank statement and may apply its own terms and compliance checks.
        </p>

        <h2>4. General refund principle</h2>
        <p>
          Because DentAIstudy is a digital, subscription-based service that grants immediate access to
          study tools and AI features, all payments are generally considered
          <strong>non-refundable once access has been granted</strong>, except where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A refund is required under applicable consumer law in your country; or</li>
          <li>We explicitly agree to a refund in one of the situations listed in Section 5.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to ask for reasonable information to verify your identity, the payment,
          and the issue before processing any refund.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Situations where we may issue a refund</h2>
        <p>
          Subject to our review, we may consider issuing a partial or full refund in the following cases. 
          Refund requests must be submitted within <strong>14 days</strong> from the original charge:
        </p>        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Duplicate payment:</strong> You were accidentally charged twice for the same
            subscription period and you notify us promptly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical issues on our side:</strong> A serious, repeated technical problem with
            DentAIstudy or our AI study builder prevents you from reasonably using the service, and
            we are unable to resolve it within a reasonable time after you contact us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accidental upgrade without usage:</strong> You upgraded by mistake, clearly did not
            use the Pro features (for example, no or minimal AI generations), and you contact us within
            a short time from the charge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal right of withdrawal:</strong> If you are located in a jurisdiction that grants
            you a statutory right to withdraw from digital subscriptions, we will follow that law as
            long as the legal conditions are met.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We handle refund requests individually. Granting a refund in one situation does
          <strong>not</strong> mean the same decision will always be made again.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Situations where refunds are not usually given</h2>
        <p>
          To protect the platform and prevent abuse, refunds are generally <strong>not</strong> provided if:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You changed your mind after using the Pro or AI features extensively (for example, many OSCE flows,
            Viva questions, or theory explanations generated).
          </li>
          <li>
            You expected a specific exam result or outcome. DentAIstudy does not guarantee passing any exam,
            securing any grade, or achieving a particular learning result.
          </li>
          <li>
            You did not read our description, limitations, or example features before subscribing.
          </li>
          <li>
            You lost access to your email, Supabase account, or device and did not contact us in time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your payment method provider (bank, card issuer, wallet) declined or reversed the transaction
            outside of our control.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Chargebacks and payment disputes</h2>
        <p>
          If you open a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank, card network, or payment provider,
          we may temporarily suspend or limit your DentAIstudy account while the dispute is being reviewed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a chargeback is found to be fraudulent or abusive, we may:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cancel your current subscription and future access to paid plans; and</li>
          <li>Refuse future orders and block new accounts linked to the same details, where reasonable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Cancellations and renewals</h2>
        <p>
          You can cancel your paid subscription at any time. Cancellation stops the next automatic renewal,
          but normally does <strong>not</strong> trigger a refund for the current billing period.
        </p>
        <p>
          After you cancel:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You keep access to Pro features until the end of the period you already paid for; then</li>
          <li>Your account may automatically switch back to the free plan, if available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. How to request a refund or raise a question</h2>
        <p>
          If you believe you qualify for a refund under this policy, or you see a charge you do not recognise,
          please contact us as soon as possible. The fastest way is through the contact form on our
          <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a> or by email at
          <a href="mailto:info@dentaistudy.com">info@dentaistudy.com</a>. Please include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The email address used for your DentAIstudy account;</li>
          <li>The date and amount of the charge, and (if available) the transaction or receipt ID; and</li>
          <li>A brief explanation of the situation and why you are requesting a refund.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may also ask you to work with our payment processor (for example, by replying to an email
          from their support) so that your case is handled correctly in their system.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy from time to time, for example when we launch
          new features, change pricing, or work with a different payment processor. The “Last updated” date
          at the top of this page shows when it was last revised.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the changes are material, we will try to provide reasonable notice (for example, via the website
          or by email) where possible. Continuing to use DentAIstudy after an update means you accept the
          revised policy.
        </p>

        <h2>11. If this policy conflicts with local law</h2>
        <p>
          Nothing in this Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy is intended to limit any mandatory consumer rights
          you may have under the laws of your country or region. If there is a conflict between this policy
          and such laws, the law will apply to the extent required.
