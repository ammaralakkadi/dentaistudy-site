            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy explains when and how
              payments for DentAIstudy subscriptions may be refunded or
              cancelled. It should be read together with our
              <a href="terms.html">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>,
              <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and
              <a href="billing.html">Billing Policy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              DentAIstudy is a small, independent educational platform focused
              on AI-assisted study tools for dental students and residents. To
              keep the service sustainable, refunds are limited and are usually
              granted only in specific situations described below.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Free plan</h2>
            <p>
              DentAIstudy may offer a free tier or trial features. The free plan
              is not charged and therefore not eligible for refunds. We may
              change, limit, or discontinue the free plan at any time.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Paid subscriptions and billing</h2>
            <p>
              When you upgrade to a paid plan (for example, a Pro subscription),
              you are charged in advance for the chosen billing period (such as
              monthly or yearly). Unless stated otherwise during checkout, all
              prices are shown in USD and may be subject to local taxes or
              currency conversion by your payment provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payments for DentAIstudy may be processed by a third-party
              reseller and merchant of record (for example, Paddle or a similar
              provider). That reseller may appear as the seller on your invoice
              or bank statement and may apply its own terms and compliance
              checks.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
            <p>
              We want all users to have a fair experience with DentAIstudy. If
              you are not satisfied with your purchase, or if something has gone
              wrong, you may request a refund. Refund requests are reviewed in
              line with the reseller or merchant of record’s policies (for
              example, Paddle’s Refund Policy).
            </p>
            <p>
              Refunds may be granted in situations such as accidental purchase,
              duplicate charge, technical issues preventing normal use of the
              service, or where required under applicable consumer protection
              law. All refund decisions are made fairly and reasonably.
            </p>

            <h2>5. How refunds are processed</h2>
            <p>
              Payments for DentAIstudy may be handled by a third-party reseller
              or merchant of record (such as Paddle). When this is the case, the
              reseller processes refunds directly in accordance with their own
              refund rules. Their name may appear on your invoice or bank
              statement.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Chargebacks</h2>
            <p>
              If you believe a charge is incorrect, we encourage you to contact
              us or our payment processor before opening a chargeback. This
              allows the issue to be resolved more quickly. However, you always
              retain the right to request a chargeback through your bank where
              applicable.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Limitations</h2>
            <p>
              Nothing in this policy affects any mandatory consumer rights you
              may have under the laws of your country or region. Where local law
              provides stronger rights, those rights will apply.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Cancellations and renewals</h2>
            <p>
              You can cancel your paid subscription at any time. Cancellation
              stops the next automatic renewal, but normally does
              <strong>not</strong> trigger a refund for the current billing
              period.
            </p>
            <p>After you cancel:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You keep access to Pro features until the end of the period you
                already paid for; then
              </li>
              <li>
                Your account may automatically switch back to the free plan, if
                available.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. How to request a refund or raise a question</h2>
            <p>
              If you believe you qualify for a refund under this policy, or you
              see a charge you do not recognise, please contact us as soon as
              possible. The fastest way is through the contact form on our
              <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a> or by email at
              <a href="mailto:info@dentaistudy.com">info@dentaistudy.com</a>.
              Please include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The email address used for your DentAIstudy account;</li>
              <li>
                The date and amount of the charge, and (if available) the
                transaction or receipt ID; and
              </li>
              <li>
                A brief explanation of the situation and why you are requesting
                a refund.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We may also ask you to work with our payment processor (for
              example, by replying to an email from their support) so that your
              case is handled correctly in their system.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy from time to
              time, for example when we launch new features, change pricing, or
              work with a different payment processor. The “Last updated” date
              at the top of this page shows when it was last revised.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the changes are material, we will try to provide reasonable
              notice (for example, via the website or by email) where possible.
              Continuing to use DentAIstudy after an update means you accept the
              revised policy.
            </p>

            <h2>11. If this policy conflicts with local law</h2>
            <p>
              Nothing in this Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy is intended to
              limit any mandatory consumer rights you may have under the laws of
              your country or region. If there is a conflict between this policy
              and such laws, the law will apply to the extent required.
