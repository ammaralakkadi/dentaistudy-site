              These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use

            </p>

            <h2>1. About DentAIstudy</h2>
            <p>
              DentAIstudy is an online platform that provides AI-powered study
              tools and educational content for dental students and
              professionals. The Service is intended for educational purposes
              only.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
              You must be at least 18 years old to use DentAIstudy. By using the
              Service, you confirm that you meet this requirement and that the
              information you provide is accurate.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
            <p>
              To access certain features, you must create an account. You are
              responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
              credentials and for all activity under your account.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Subscriptions & payments</h2>
            <p>
              DentAIstudy offers free and paid subscription plans. Paid plans
              are billed on a recurring monthly or yearly basis, as shown on the
              Pricing page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payments are processed securely by third-party payment providers.

            <h2>5. Renewals & cancellations</h2>
            <p>
              Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing
              period unless cancelled before the renewal date.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account
              settings. Cancellation stops future billing but does not
              automatically issue a refund.
