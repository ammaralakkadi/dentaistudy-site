      <h2>1. About DentAIstudy</h2>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy is an independent educational platform created by orthodontic residents and dental learners to help students
        study more efficiently using AI-assisted tools. We provide study helpers such as explanations, OSCE flows, flashcards,
        checklists, and structured prompts focused on dentistry and related subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy is <strong>not</strong> a hospital, clinic, or official university system. We do not provide medical or dental
        diagnosis, treatment plans, or patient management. The platform is designed purely for learning and exam preparation.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Acceptance of these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using DentAIstudy in any way (including browsing, creating an account, or using AI tools), you agree to
        be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions and any additional policies that are referenced here, such as our
        <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="cookies.html">Cookies Policy</a> (if applicable).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use DentAIstudy.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Eligibility and user accounts</h2>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy is intended primarily for dental students, recent graduates, and learners in related fields. By using the platform,
        you confirm that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are at least 16 years old (or older, if your local law requires a higher minimum age to use online services).</li>
        <li>You have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</li>
        <li>You will use the platform only for lawful and educational purposes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you create an account, you agree to provide accurate information, keep your login credentials confidential, and be responsible
        for all activities that happen under your account. If you suspect unauthorized use of your account, you should notify us as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Educational use only – no clinical decisions</h2>
      <p>
        All content on DentAIstudy, including AI-generated answers, OSCE scenarios, flashcards, and any text you see on the website,
        is intended for educational, revision, and exam-preparation use only.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> use DentAIstudy to make real clinical decisions for patients.</li>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> treat AI outputs as a substitute for textbooks, guidelines, or supervision from qualified clinicians.</li>
        <li>Always confirm information with trusted sources and your faculty, supervisors, or local protocols.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for how you apply any knowledge gained from DentAIstudy in practice or exams.
      </p>

      <h2>5. AI-generated content and limitations</h2>
      <p>
        Many features of DentAIstudy rely on AI models to generate content based on your prompts and inputs. While we aim to provide
        high-quality, structured, and exam-focused outputs, AI can sometimes produce incorrect, outdated, or incomplete information.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI outputs may contain errors or simplifications and should always be cross-checked against reliable sources.</li>
        <li>We do not guarantee that any specific output is clinically accurate, exhaustive, or aligned with your local curriculum.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for any decisions or actions you take based on AI-generated content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Your content</h2>
      <p>
        You may upload, type, or otherwise submit content to DentAIstudy, including prompts, notes, OSCE cases, and flashcards
        (collectively, “Your Content”). You remain the owner of Your Content, but you grant us a limited license to use it in order
        to provide and improve the service.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You represent that you have the right to use and share Your Content.</li>
        <li>You agree not to upload content that is illegal, abusive, discriminatory, or violates someone else’s rights.</li>
        <li>You agree not to include real patient names, ID numbers, or other direct identifiers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By using DentAIstudy, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to store, process, and display Your Content
        as needed to operate the platform, personalize your experience, back up data, and improve our tools (including via aggregated
        and de-identified analysis).
      </p>

      <h2>7. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree that you will <strong>not</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use DentAIstudy in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        <li>Attempt to hack, overburden, disrupt, or reverse engineer any part of the platform.</li>
        <li>Use automated tools (bots, scripts, scrapers) to access or copy large parts of the service without permission.</li>
        <li>Upload malicious code, spam, or content that is defamatory, hateful, or otherwise harmful.</li>
        <li>Misrepresent your identity or pretend to be someone else.</li>
        <li>Sell, resell, or commercially exploit the platform or its outputs without our written consent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        The DentAIstudy platform, including its design, layout, branding, and underlying code, is owned by us or licensed to us
        and is protected by intellectual property laws. This does not include Your Content or content you are allowed to use under
        separate open licenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may view and use the platform for your personal educational purposes. Unless we explicitly allow it, you may not:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copy significant portions of the website or app for public redistribution.</li>
        <li>Remove or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices.</li>
        <li>Use our name, logo, or branding in a way that suggests official partnership without permission.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Beta features and changes to the service</h2>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy is actively being improved. From time to time, we may introduce new features, change existing ones, or
        remove parts of the platform.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some tools may be labeled as “beta” or “experimental” and could be less stable or accurate.</li>
        <li>We may modify or discontinue features without prior notice, where reasonably necessary for technical, security, or business reasons.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Fees and payment (if applicable)</h2>
      <p>
        At the moment, parts of DentAIstudy may be free to use. If we introduce paid plans or subscriptions in the future,
        additional terms about pricing, billing, and refunds will apply and will be clearly communicated to you before you pay.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not make
        any warranties or promises about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any content (including AI-generated answers).</li>
        <li>The platform being error-free, uninterrupted, or always available.</li>
        <li>Meeting every specific requirement of your curriculum, exam board, or institution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You use DentAIstudy at your own risk and remain responsible for verifying any information before relying on it.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent allowed by law, DentAIstudy and its team will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
        or consequential damages, or any loss of data, exam results, or opportunities arising from your use of (or inability to use)
        the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where liability cannot be excluded, it will be limited to the amount you paid us (if any) for using DentAIstudy in the
        3 months before the event giving rise to the claim.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Termination and suspension</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using DentAIstudy at any time and, if available, you may delete your account. We reserve the right to suspend
        or terminate your access if we reasonably believe that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have seriously or repeatedly violated these Terms.</li>
        <li>Your use of the platform causes risk or harm to other users, to us, or to third parties.</li>
        <li>We are required to do so by law or by a competent authority.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where reasonable, we will try to notify you before such action, but this may not always be possible (for example, in urgent cases).
      </p>

      <h2>14. Third-party links and services</h2>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy may include links to third-party websites, tools, or content. These are provided for convenience or additional learning,
        but we do not control or endorse them, and we are not responsible for their content, policies, or availability.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our platform, our practices, or applicable laws.
        When we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and, where appropriate,
        provide additional notice (for example, inside the app or by email, if you have an account).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you continue to use DentAIstudy after the new Terms become effective, you will be considered to have accepted them.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Governing law and disputes</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are intended to be applied in a fair and common-sense way. If a dispute arises between you and us, we encourage
        you to contact us first so we can try to resolve it informally.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent allowed by local law, and unless otherwise required, any legal disputes relating to these Terms or to DentAIstudy
        will be handled under the laws and courts that reasonably apply to our place of operation.
      </p>
