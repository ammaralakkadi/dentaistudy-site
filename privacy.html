<h2>1. About DentAIstudy and this policy</h2>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy is an independent educational platform created by orthodontic residents to help dental students study more effectively using AI-assisted tools.
        We are not a hospital, clinic, or official university platform, and we do not provide diagnosis or treatment. This Privacy Policy applies to our website,
        web app, and any related services that link to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using DentAIstudy, you agree that we may process your information as described here. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the platform.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information we need to run DentAIstudy and improve your study experience:</p>

      <h3>A. Information you provide directly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account details</strong> – such as your name, email address, and password (stored in a hashed form, not as plain text).</li>
        <li><strong>Study content</strong> – prompts you type, subjects you create, OSCE flows, flashcards, notes, and other educational content you save.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication</strong> – messages you send us via the contact form or support channels, including any attachments or screenshots.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. Information collected automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage data</strong> – basic analytics about how you interact with the website (for example: pages visited, buttons clicked, time spent).</li>
        <li><strong>Device and log information</strong> – such as IP address, browser type, and general device information that helps us troubleshoot and improve stability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C. Cookies and local storage</h3>
      <p>
        We currently rely mainly on essential cookies and similar technologies to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>keep you logged in and secure;</li>
        <li>remember basic preferences (for example, language);</li>
        <li>protect the platform from abuse and spam.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we introduce additional analytics or preference cookies in the future, we will update this policy and, where required, ask for your consent.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To provide and maintain the service</strong> – creating your account, keeping you signed in, and saving your study materials and history.</li>
        <li><strong>To personalize your study experience</strong> – for example, remembering your subjects, recent prompts, and preferred tools.</li>
        <li><strong>To improve DentAIstudy</strong> – understanding what features are used most, fixing bugs, and planning new tools.</li>
        <li><strong>To communicate with you</strong> – sending important notices about your account, security updates, or changes to this policy.</li>
        <li><strong>To keep the platform safe</strong> – detecting misuse, spam, or behavior that could harm other users or the service.</li>
        <li><strong>To comply with law</strong> – where we are required to keep certain records or respond to lawful requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. AI tools and your study content</h2>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy uses AI models to generate study content such as explanations, OSCE flows, classifications, or flashcards. When you use these tools,
        the text you type and the AI-generated outputs may be temporarily processed by our AI infrastructure providers to return the result to you.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The content you create (prompts, notes, subjects, etc.) may be stored in your account so you can access it later.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use your identifiable personal details to show you ads or sell your information.</li>
        <li>We may use aggregated and de-identified data (for example, feature usage statistics) to understand how the platform is used and to improve our tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> DentAIstudy is for education only. Please do not enter real patient names, ID numbers, or other direct identifiers into the platform.
      </p>

      <h2>5. What we do <em>not</em> do with your data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> share your study content with advertisers.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use DentAIstudy to provide medical diagnosis or individualized treatment plans.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Legal bases (for users in the EU/EEA and similar regions)</h2>
      <p>
        Where data protection laws such as the GDPR apply, we process your information based on the following legal grounds:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract</strong> – to provide the services you sign up for (for example, running your account and saving your study materials).</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to improve and secure DentAIstudy, prevent abuse, and understand how the platform is used.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for certain optional features, such as specific types of cookies or communications, where required.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> – when we must keep or disclose information under applicable law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. When we share your information</h2>
      <p>
        We only share your information with third parties when it is necessary for running DentAIstudy, when you ask us to, or when we are legally required to do so.
        Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers</strong> – such as hosting providers, email delivery services, and AI infrastructure partners that help us operate the platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and security tools</strong> – to understand usage and protect against abuse, always under appropriate safeguards.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal reasons</strong> – if we believe disclosure is required to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or government request.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers</strong> – if we undergo a merger, reorganization, or similar event, your information may be part of the transferred assets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These partners are only allowed to use your information to provide services to us and must handle it securely.
      </p>

      <h2>8. International data transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Because DentAIstudy may use servers and service providers in different countries, your information may be processed in a country different from where you live.
        Where required, we take reasonable steps to ensure that such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your information remains protected.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your information only for as long as it is needed for the purposes described in this policy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Account data and saved study content are kept while your account is active.</li>
        <li>If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal information within a reasonable period, except where we are required to keep some data for legal or security reasons.</li>
        <li>Technical logs and backups are kept for limited periods and then deleted or anonymized.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Your choices and rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have certain rights over your personal information. In all cases, we aim to give you clear choices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and update</strong> – you can review and update certain account details by logging into your profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete your account</strong> – you can request deletion of your account and associated personal data by contacting us via the <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication preferences</strong> – if we send you non-essential emails, you can usually opt out using the unsubscribe link or by contacting us.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookie controls</strong> – your browser or device may allow you to block or delete cookies. Some features of DentAIstudy may not work properly if essential cookies are disabled.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If local law gives you additional rights (for example, to object to certain processing, or to request data portability), you can reach out through the contact form and we will do our best to help.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information, such as encrypted connections (HTTPS), secure password storage, and access controls.
        However, no online service can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help protect your account, please use a strong password, keep it secret, and let us know promptly if you suspect any unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy is designed primarily for dental students and similar learners. It is not intended for children under 16 years of age.
        If you are under 16, you should only use DentAIstudy with supervision and permission where this is required by local law.
        If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child contrary to this policy, we will take steps to delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Third-party links</h2>
      <p>
        DentAIstudy may contain links to other websites or resources (for example, articles, videos, or external tools).
        We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external sites you visit.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our platform or in applicable laws.
        When we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and, where appropriate, provide additional notice (for example, in-app or by email).
      </p>

      <h2>15. How to contact us</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your information, you can reach us through the
        <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a> on the website. We will do our best to respond within a reasonable time.
